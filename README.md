# mupplets [WIP]

**Note:** This is very much a work-in-progress. Interface and messages are NOT stable or final.

**mu**werk a**pplets**; mupplets: functional units that support specific hardware or reusable applications.

**mupplets** use muwerks MQTT-style messaging to pass information between each other on the same device. If connected to an MQTT-server via munet, all functionallity is externally available through an MQTT server such as Mosquitto.

See [mupplet led and switch example](https://github.com/muwerk/Examples/tree/master/led) for a complete example that illustrates how a
switch mupplet (interfacing to a physical button) and a led mupplet (infacing to a physical led) communicate using muwerk.
Both switch and led are also accessible via external MQTT without extra code.

## Dependencies

* Note: **All** mupplets require the libraries [ustd](https://github.com/muwerk/ustd) and [muwerk](https://github.com/muwerk/muwerk).

Currently, mupplets work only with ESP8266 or ESP32, due to usage of `std::function<>` to register member tasks. This restriction will
change in a later release.

It is recommended to use [munet](https://github.com/muwerk/munet) for network connectivity.

## Application notes

### ldr.h

The ldr mupplet measures luminosity using a simple analog LDR (light dependent resistor)

#### Messages sent by ldr mupplet:

| topic | message body | comment
| ----- | ------------ | -------
| `<mupplet-name>/unitluminosity` | luminosity [0.0-1.0] | Float value encoded as string


<img src="https://github.com/muwerk/mupplets/blob/master/Resources/ldr.png" width="30%" height="30%">
Hardware: LDR, 10k立 resistor

#### Sample code
```cpp
#include "ldr.h"

ustd::Scheduler sched;
ustd::Ldr ldr("myLDR",A0);

void task0(String topic, String msg, String originator) {
    if (topic == "myLDR/unitluminosity") {
        Serial.print("Lumin: ");
        Serial.prinln(msg);  // String float [0.0, ..., 1.0]
    }
}

void setup() {
   ldr.begin(&sched);

   sched.subscribe(tID, "myLDR/unitluminosity", task0);
}
```
### led.h

Allows to set LEDs via digital logic or PWM brightness.

<img src="https://github.com/muwerk/mupplets/blob/master/Resources/led.png" width="30%" height="30%">
Hardware: 330立 resistor, led.

#### Messages send by led mupplet:

| topic | message body | comment
| ----- | ------------ | -------
| `<mupplet-name>/led/unitluminosity` | luminosity [0.0-1.0] | `0.34`: Float value encoded as string. Not send on automatic changes (e.g. pulse mode)
| `<mupplet-name>/led/state` | `on` or `off` | current led state (`on` is not sent on pwm intermediate values)

#### Message received by led mupplet:

| topic | message body | comment
| ----- | ------------ | -------
| `<mupplet-name>/led/set` | `on`, `off`, `true`, `false`, `pct 34`, `34%`, `0.34` | Led can be set fully on or off with on/true and off/false. A fractional brightness of 0.34 (within interval [0.0, 1.0]) can be sent as either `pct 34`, or `0.34`, or `34%`.
| `<mupplet-name>/led/mode/set` | `passive`, `pulse <duration_ms>`, `blink <intervall_ms>[,<phase-shift>]`, `pattern <pattern>[,<intervall>[,<phase>]]` or `wave <intervall_ms>[,<phase-shift>]` | Mode passive does no automatic led state changes, `pulse` switches the led on for `<duration_ms>` ms, then led goes back to passive mode. `blink` changes the led state very `interval_ms` on/off, `wave` uses pwm to for soft changes between on and off states. Optional comma-speratated phase [0.0, ..., 1.0] can be added as a phase-shift. Two leds, one with `wave 1000` and one with `wave 1000,0.5` blink inverse. Patterns can be specified as string containing `+`,`-`,`0`..`9` or `r`. `+` is led on during `<intervall>` ms, `-` is off, `0`..`9` brightness-level. An `r` at the end of the pattern repeats the pattern. `"pattern +-+-+-+++-+++-+++-+-+-+---r,100"` lets the board signal SOS.

Example: sending an MQTT message with topic `<led-name>/mode/set` and message `wave 1000` causes the led to softly pulse between on and off every 1000ms.

Multiple leds are time and phase synchronized.

### Sample code

```cpp
#include "led.h"

ustd::Led led("myLed",D5,false); 
            // Led connected to pin D5, 
            // false: led is on when D5 low
            // (inverted logic)
            // messages are sent/received to myLed/led/...

void setup() {

    led.begin(&sched);
    led.setmode(led.Mode::WAVE, 1000);
            // soft pwm pulsing in 1000ms intervals
            // same can be accomplished by publishing
            // topic myLed/led/setmode  msg "wave 1000"
```

## Switch

Support switches with automatic debouncing.

<img src="https://github.com/muwerk/mupplets/blob/master/Resources/switch.png" width="50%" height="30%">
Hardware: 330立 resistor, led, switch.

#### Messages send by switch mupplet:

| topic | message body | comment
| ----- | ------------ | -------
| `<mupplet-name>/switch/state` | `on`, `off` or `trigger` | switch state, usually `on` or `off`. In modes `falling` and `raising` only `trigger`
messages are sent on raising or falling signal.
| `<mupplet-name>/switch/debounce` | <time-in-ms> | reply to `<mupplet-name>/switch/debounce/get`, switch debounce time in ms [0..1000]ms
| `<custom-topic>` |  | `on`, `off` or `trigger` | If a custom-topic is given during switch init, an addtional message is publish on switch state changes with that topic, The message is identical to ../switch/state', usually `on` or `off`. In modes `falling` and `raising` only `trigger`.

#### Message received by switch mupplet:

| topic | message body | comment
| ----- | ------------ | -------
| `<mupplet-name>/switch/set` | `on`, `off`, `true`, `false`, `toggle` | Override switch setting. When setting the switch state via message, the hardware port remains overridden until the hardware changes state (e.g. button is physically pressed). Sending a `switch/set` message puts the switch in override-mode: e.g. when sending `switch/set` `on`, the state of the button is signalled `on`, even so the physical button might be off. Next time the physical button is pressed (or changes state), override mode is stopped, and the state of the actual physical button is published again.  
| `<mupplet-name>/switch/mode/set` | `default`, `raising`, `falling`, `flipflop`, `timer <time-in-ms>` | Mode `default` sends `on` when a button is pushed, `off` on release. `falling` and `raising` send `trigger` on corresponding signal change. `flipflop` changes the state of the logical switch on each change from button on to off. `timer` keeps
the switch on for the specified duration (ms). 
| `<mupplet-name>/switch/debounce/set` | <time-in-ms> | String encoded switch debounce time in ms, [0..1000]ms. Default is 20ms.

### Sample code

```cpp
#include "led.h"
#include "switch.h"

ustd::Scheduler sched;
ustd::Led led("myLed",D5,false);
ustd::Switch toggleswitch("mySwitch",D6, ustd::Switch::Mode::Default, false);

void switch_messages(String topic, String msg, String originator) {
    if (topic == "mySwitch/switch/state") {
        if (msg=="on") {
            led.set(true);
        } else {
            led.set(false);
        }
    }
}

void setup() {
    led.begin(&sched);
    toggleswitch.begin(&sched);
    toggleswitch.setMode(ustd::Mode::Flipflop);
    sched.subscribe(tID, "mySwitch/switch/state", switch_messages);
}
```

ustd::Dht dht("myDht",D4);

void sensor_messages(String topic, String msg, String originator) {
    if (topic == "myDht/temperature") {
        Serial.println("Temperature: "+msg);
    }
    if (topic == "myDht/humidity") {

## I2C 16 channel PWM module based on PCA9685

Allows to control up to 16 PWM leds or servos.

<img src="https://github.com/muwerk/mupplets/blob/master/Resources/i2c_pwm_servo.png" width="70%" height="30%">
Hardware: PCA9685 based I2C-PWM board.

#### Notes

* This mupplet can either be in mode `Mode::PWM` or `Mode::SERVO`. In `PWM` mode, the pwm frequency is 1000Hz by default,
in `SERVO` mode, frequency is 60Hz. All 16 channels share the same mode. The global pwm frequency can be overriden with `setFrequency(freq)`.
* Servo minma and maxima can be configured with `void setServoMinMax(int minP=150, int maxP=600) { // pulses out of 4096 at 60hz (frequency)`. See [Adafruit's excellent documentation](https://learn.adafruit.com/16-channel-pwm-servo-driver/using-the-adafruit-library) for more details on servo callibration.
* Max 25mA per channel!


#### Messages received by switch mupplet:

| topic | message body | comment
| ----- | ------------ | -------
| `<mupplet-name>/i2cpwm/set/<channel-no>` |  `on`, `off`, `true`, `false`, `pct 34`, `34%`, `0.34` | For leds, results in set fully on or off with on/true and off/false. A fractional brightness of 0.34 (within interval [0.0, 1.0]) can be sent as either `pct 34`, or `0.34`, or `34%`. For `Mode::SERVO` this results in a servo-position proportional to the value [0..1]. 

### Sample code

```cpp
#include "i2c_pwm.h"

ustd::Scheduler sched(10,16,32);
ustd::I2CPWM servo("myServo",ustd::I2CPWM::Mode::SERVO);

double count=0.0;
void appLoop() { // change servo every 500ms
    servo.setUnitLevel(15,count);  // change servo at channel 15.
    count+=0.2;
    if (count>1.0) count=0.0;
}

void setup() {
    int tID = sched.add(appLoop, "main", 500000); // 500ms schedule for appLoop task
    servo.begin(&sched);
}

```
